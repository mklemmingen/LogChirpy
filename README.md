## 1. Introduction / Motivation

LogChirpy is a mobile application that elevates the nature experience of bird watching to a new level – for beginners as well as experienced ornithologists. The application enables versatile documentation of bird observations: through photos, audio recordings of bird calls, or manual entries – each optionally supplemented with GPS coordinates.

### Modern Technology Meets Nature Observation

LogChirpy combines the classic hobby of bird watching with modern technology. Through integration of the BirdNET API, users can analyze bird calls and automatically identify bird species. Additionally, optional local recognition via TensorFlow.js is enabled – based on audio or image data, directly on the device.

The integration of OpenStreetMap allows precise real-time geolocation and provides a visual overview of one's own sightings.

### Multilingual & Knowledge Access

The app is built completely bilingual (German/English) and allows quick switching between languages. Additionally, users can directly access the appropriate Wikipedia article for a recognized bird species – for immediate further information.

### Cloud Integration & Data Privacy

For optional synchronization, Firebase connectivity is available:
- Firebase Authentication secures login and protects user data
- Firestore stores observations, user profiles, images, and location data – if the user wishes. Usage is also possible offline

### Media Processing & Sharing

Recorded images are automatically compressed and can be shared directly via the operating system. A special function is sticker creation: recognized birds can be cut out from images and exported as WhatsApp stickers – or made available for other messengers and image editing apps.
